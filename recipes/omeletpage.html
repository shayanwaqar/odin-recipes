    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p style="color: blue; background-color:lightgray;">Omelet making is a skill that takes time, patience, a gentle touch, and a whole lot of eggs and butter. The absolute perfect French omelet should be smooth and pale (there should never be any browning) on the outside and creamy, curdy, and custardy on the inside. With that said, even omelets that are just shy of perfect are still insanely delicious, perhaps just a bit rough around the edges. Ready to give it a whirl?</p>
